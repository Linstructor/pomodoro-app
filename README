# Pomodoro App

This is a simple pomodoro app with elegant UI without useless element.
It has been developed with Electron and Vue.js on mac os, so it might present some UI error on Linux and Windows.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project has been created with Node Js so you need :

```
Node.js v11.1 (can work with a lower version)

### Installing

Has a simple node project you only need to run ``npm install`` to get all the dependencies and run the app
After having installed the dependencies run ``npm run start`` to start it.


### And coding style tests

Here are two command to develop the front:
